# Advanced-Python
## Chapter One
This repository stablished in order to train some important and notable **Python** commands. 
In order to get the contents, it is necessary to be familiar with some basic Python (programming) commands as `for`, `if & else`, `while`, `end`, `def` and ...

But after all, Python has been included many **Libraries** for various purpose. In this training repository, following libraries would be applied
- Numpy : See [here](https://numpy.org/) for more info about numpy
- Scipy : See [here](https://scipy.org/) for more info about scipy
- Matplotlib : See [here](https://matplotlib.org/) for more info about matplotlib
- Pandas : See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for more info about pandas
## Numpy
## Scipy
> SciPy is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem
domains in scientific computing
## Matplotlib
> matplotlib is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other 2D data
visualizations. It was originally created by John D. Hunter (JDH) and is now maintained
by a large team of developers. It is well-suited for creating plots suitable for publication.
## Pandas
> pandas provides rich data structures and functions designed to make working with
structured data fast, easy, and expressive. It is, as you will see, one of the critical in-
gredients enabling Python to be a powerful and productive data analysis environment.

#### Following topics are trained in this repo.
- Lambda function
- map and filter
- generatores 
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
